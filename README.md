# Analysis of Performance and Predictive Modeling in the NFL Regular Season

This report examines the predictive modeling of NFL quarterbacks' performances using linear regression to forecast Passing Expected Points Added (EPA). Analyzing 2023 season data, we trained a model with early-season games and tested its predictions against later games, achieving an RMSE of 5.14. The results, including a scatterplot and residuals analysis, suggest moderate accuracy with room for improvement. Recommendations for model refinement are discussed, with implications for enhancing team strategy and performance analysis.
